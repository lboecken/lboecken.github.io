# And even more react and some progress

Am getting a better grasp of state and passing it around. Am able to pass the values from the  Input form to the table. 
They are not yet dynamic but that is ok. It was a rough evening and I definitely am pushing myself right now but am glad to at least make some progress.

Am celebrating this victory.
