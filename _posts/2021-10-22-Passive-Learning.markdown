## _Successes_

### Creating my copyProjectTemplate.py script

this script is available globally and creates a readme file and a folder containing planning documents. Currently that is only the project plan but I may add some more to it. This could be a good step towards creating more useful scripts.

## \*Failures

### lack of focus

not a terrible day but overall I was not the most focused. I did not make a good plan and did not stick to it very well either. Did not do any HTML & CSS stuff today and was limited in the javascript section. The dry learning is sometimes pretty rough.
