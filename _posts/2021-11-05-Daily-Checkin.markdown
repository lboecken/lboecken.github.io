## _Things I Did Today_

<ol>
<li>JS Behind the Scenes</li>
    <ol>
    <li>Event Loop: The core of how JS runs on execution. It consists of the Web API (if in browser), the Callback Stack, Microtasks & The Stack. Not sure exactly how it all works.
    It runs in a loop, there is some order of precedence on what happens when, the callback stack is emtpied beofre the regular stack resumes ( I think?)</li>
    </ol>
<li>AST</li>
    <ol>
    <li>Abstract Syntax Tree: An HTML DOM equivalent in JS. It is a tree representation of JS code. Tools like https://astexplorer.net/ allow 
    you to look at the tree. Tools like ESLint allow error messages to pop up when code does not meet stylistic or programmatic guidelines.
    jscodeshift allows you to actually modify files and clean them up (such as removing all Debugger or console.log statements from the files Or renaming variables or references.
    As an example, a 200 line project (my calculator App), produces an AST in JSON format of 5660 lines. This means a very thorough and information rich way to interact with my javascript code.
    ASTexplorer will be great tool as it allows me to write my own rules to produce new code and generates it in the browser. I could use this to play around with modifying AST to my advantage.
