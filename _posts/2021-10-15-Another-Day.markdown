    </br> Furthermore, did get a lot better at finding solutions than some previous projects. Still need to refactor though. 
    </li>
    <li> Local storage. New thing I learned today. Turned out really easy actually. function to get it, add to it and delete from it.
    </br> took maybe 20 minutes to set that all up once I figured the logic out.

    <li>Deployed to Heroku. Just need to finished the styling and to refactor the thing and then I am done!!</li>
    </ol>
</ol>

## _Successes_

### FrontEnd Mentor

With a clear design, was able to build for 1 hour on a simple project. Overall
Am very happy with how close I am getting to the specified design. This actually
makes CSS practice way more fun since I am working towards something. Looking forward
to more of that.

## _Failures_

## _Improvements_

Definitely am not focused as much during video training & notetaking but these do form a solid foundation. Need to focus more during these sessions.

# Final Thoughts

Solid day! Gettting ready to party. Looking forward to what next week holds. Short week overall but with everything going on that is ok.
