    <ol>

<li>React Learning</li>
    <ol>
    <li>
    Events Handling:
        React events are similar to DOM events with HTML. Main thing is the syntax is
        slightly different since you are using JSX. class components create event handlers
        as methods of the class and bind them in the constructor to use the correct 'this'
        Functional components use variables to create event handlers. Parameters are easy
        to pass in. 
    </li>
    <li>Scrimba course:
        Basic lessons on creating, importing, etc. Practical in nature    
    </li>
    </ol>
<li>Javascript Course</li>
    <ol>
    <li>DOM Manipulation video. Watching on high speed & building simple apps using provided tools in lesson. </li>
    </ol>

## _Successes_

### Finishing the Expense Tracker with React

The refactor early was relatively painless and same with integrating react-hook-form. Bootstrap was definitely confusing at first though. I did do decent with it.

# Final Thoughts

Tomorrow plan on working on CSS & HTML Udemy, React Scrimba & Javascript Udemy. Finally want to get a lay of the land
for the next project.
